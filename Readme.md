Architecture overview:
1) Take input using form.
2) On submit, show the user submitted query in the result section.

Requirements:
I used React.js as UI framework to develop this.
npm is required on the machine.

Running the project:
1) Download the project and run
```npm start``` in the downloaded directory.
This will start the app on ```localhost:3000```
2) To run the automated tests
```npm test```
